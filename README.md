## SQL Learning 

### SQL Basics

In the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science"> SQL for Data Science Course</a> made by University of California, Davis and offered on Coursera, I got to learn SQL querying using Chinook Database and for my project I analyzed a Yelp Database(refer to link below). In this project, I answered a series of questions to understand the various tables within this dataset. I also came up with my own inferences to determine the relationship between popular attributes of restaurants in Phoenix, Arizona and higher star counts.
